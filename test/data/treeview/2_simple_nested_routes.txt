# Routes that should build simple nested route tree (1 parent, 1 leaf)

           root GET          /                           clients#index
        clients GET          /clients(.:format)          clients#index
     new_client GET          /clients/new(.:format)      clients#new
    edit_client GET          /clients/:id/edit(.:format) clients#edit

# In without semantic grouping these routes should build the next tree:
#
# clients
#   :id
#     edit
#   new
# /
# clients
